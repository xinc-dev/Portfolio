# Eurovision Data Analysis Project

## ⚠️ Execution Environment
This project is designed to be run **exclusively in Google Colab**.  
Due to NLP workloads, memory requirements, and interactive visualizations, the notebook is **not intended to be executed locally**.

---

## How to Run the Code

1. Open the notebook **`final_project_Colab.ipynb`** in **Google Colab**  
   (Do not run this notebook on a local machine.)

2. Run the notebook **from top to bottom**.

3. In the second code cell, you will be prompted to **manually upload** the file:
   - `eurovision_2016-25.csv`

   > ⚠️ Note: This file was modified to include 2025 data.  
   > The original Kaggle version will **not** work correctly.

4. Lyrics data handling:
   - The notebook first attempts to load lyrics from the original Kaggle dataset.
   - If this fails, you will be prompted to manually upload the backup file:
     - `eurovision-lyrics-2025.json`

## File Overview

- **`final_project_Colab.ipynb`**  
  Full analysis notebook containing code, comments, and results.

## Setup Requirements

- **Google Colab** (no local installation required)
- **Kaggle API access** (only if downloading datasets directly from Kaggle)
- Manual upload of the following files when prompted:
